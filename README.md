# Life As Weeks
Tim Urban of Wait but Why wrote a post discussing the week as a natural chunk in which to subdivide life.   https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html It is a good idea - the week is a very natural unit - indeed the week based system has been in use far longer than our calendar.  He even provides some basic posters with 52 x 90 blocks that you can mark up.

But I wanted to do something more sophisticated.  First of all, I'm lazy, and the idea of physically looking up dates and counting out the weeks seemed like a job for the computer to do.  Second, there are 52 weeks _plus one day_ in each year, except leap years which have two extra days.  Which is a minor difference, except when it's not.  After a couple decades, theres some missing weeks, and the week count will move around noticeably relative to the seasons.

Thus was born the life as weeks generator.  Intended to take a list of dates, and some options, it generates a day-accurate chart of weeks, with the calendar overlaid.
